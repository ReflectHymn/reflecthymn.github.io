The purpose of the ReflectHymn project is to reflect the glory of our Triune God in new music — excellent, singable melodies joined with biblically sound words — to be sung to the glory of God.

At present, we are concentrating on new tunes to go with existing words. We welcome any suggestions you have for hymns or poems that need new tunes. We are also working up our poetry skills, so as to contribute to this aspect of hymn writing.

Our goal for 2011 was to release one new song per month on this web site.
